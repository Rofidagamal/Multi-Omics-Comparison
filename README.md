**OMIDR (Omics Integration for Dimensionality Reduction)**
OMIDR is a tool designed for performing feature selection on multi-omics data, specifically for transcriptomic (trans) and microbiomic (micro) data. It helps in identifying the top features from each omic type, aiding in dimensionality reduction and enhancing data analysis efficiency.
